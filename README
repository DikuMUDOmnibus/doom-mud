Updated: May 2015

Welcome to Hell!  I hope you suffer during your stay!

Current development of PhobosMUD is done by madvlad and jogee486.

Based on the great CircleMUD (which is based on the great DikuMUD Gamma)!


About PhobosMUD
---------------

PhobosMUD is a Multi-User Dungeon, a modification on top of the CircleMUD codebase.
It is set in a world greatly inspired by Doom I/II and Shadowrun. PhobosMUD is more
action and combat oriented than most other MUDs, with a greater reliance on co-op
gameplay and dungeon crawling than what you world normally expect.

Sit back, relax, and blow some demons to Hell!

For a small, private MUD, or a MUD used only for testing and development,
about 10 megs of disk space and 16 megs of memory should be sufficient.
For large, public MUDs with a large player base, 30 megs to 50 megs of
disk space and at least 32 megs of memory are recommended.  Free memory
is much more important than CPU speed; PhobosMUD uses virtually no CPU
time.
