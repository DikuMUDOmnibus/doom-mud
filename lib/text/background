ONCE YOU BEAT THE BIG BADASSES AND
  CLEAN OUT THE MOON BASE YOU'RE SUPPOSED
  TO WIN, AREN'T YOU? AREN'T YOU? WHERE'S
  YOUR FAT REWARD AND TICKET HOME? WHAT
  THE HELL IS THIS? IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO
  END THIS WAY!

  IT STINKS LIKE ROTTEN MEAT, BUT LOOKS
  LIKE THE LOST PHOBOS BASE. LOOKS LIKE
  YOU'RE STUCK ON THE SHORES OF HELL.
  THE ONLY WAY OUT IS THROUGH.
